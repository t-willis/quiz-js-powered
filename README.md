# JavaScript Powered Quiz

---
## Description

This project is a quiz powered almost entirely by JavaScript. Changing the HTML document, populating the page with questions, transitioning between questions, and localStorage all dealt with by the js.

I wanted to learn more about how to utilize click events to trigger things happening in the webapp, and this was a great way to do so. I also learned a lot about manipulating and changing variables based on using a timer method.
